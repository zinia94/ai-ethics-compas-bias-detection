# Fairness Evaluation on COMPAS Dataset

This notebook investigates algorithmic fairness using the COMPAS dataset, focusing on three types of discrimination:

- **Disparate Treatment**
- **Disparate Impact**
- **Disparate Mistreatment**

It includes methods for detection and mitigation, such as feature exclusion, reweighting, and post-processing with threshold optimization. The notebook provides both metrics and visualizations to evaluate fairness and performance trade-offs.
